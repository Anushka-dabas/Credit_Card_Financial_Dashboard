# 💳 Credit Insights: Weekly Credit Card Dashboard

## 📋 Project Objective

A Power BI dashboard designed to track and analyse weekly and year-to-date (YTD) credit card metrics. It helps stakeholders monitor revenue, transactions, customer behaviour, and card performance across categories, segments, and geographies to support strategic decision-making.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualisation platform used for report creation.
• 📂 SQL Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• 📝 Data Modelling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

## 📂 Data Source

Data from weekly and YTD reports, including revenue, transactions, interest, customer demographics (age, gender, income, education, dependents, marital status), card types (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum), transaction modes (Swipe, Chip, Online), and geographic performance across states like TX, NY, and CA. 
The datasets are provided as structured Excel files and updated every week for reporting and analysis.

## ✨ Features / Highlights

### 📊 Business Problem
